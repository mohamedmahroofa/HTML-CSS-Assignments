            family, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four. 
            He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.
            Raised by his mother, Kareema Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led 
            to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother was summoned and was told 
            to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school any more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year, and later joined the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School,
            where he was admitted on his music talent and formed a band with his high school classmates. However, after discussing 
            with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.
